# Task 1.4: Unit Test Foundation

**Phase**: 1 (Foundation)  
**Complexity**: Small  
**Status**: Not Started

## Description

Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure and conventions for the project.

## Details

- Create test database setup/teardown helpers in `/internal/testing/` package
- Configure test environment with `_test.go` file naming conventions
- Create mock fixtures for:
  - PlaylistItem (with various content types)
  - FilterConfig (with different filter patterns)
  - ProcessingLog
- Implement helper functions:
  - Test database initialization (temporary PostgreSQL or SQLite)
  - Fixture builders for easy test data creation
  - Table cleanup between tests
- Establish table-driven test patterns for use across project
- Create test utilities for common assertions
- Set up code coverage measurement configuration
- Document testing guidelines for contributors
